      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Ebeats primary goal is to simplify the way people in different time zones
        communicate about time, mostly by eliminating time zones altogether.  The idea
        is not unique, Swatch Internet Time was the primary influence of ebeats, the 
        main difference being ebeats are not based on the time at Swatch headquarters 
        (GMT+1).
      </p>
      <p>
        Swatch Internet Time (or beat time) is a decimal time concept
        introduced in 1998 and marketed by the Swatch corporation as an
        alternative, decimal measure of time.

      <h2>Beats</h2>
      <p>
        Instead of hours and minutes, the mean solar day is divided up into
        1000 parts called "ebeats". Each ebeat lasts 1 minute and 26.4 seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further granularity (decibeats) were not seen necessary as ebeats is meant to be
        a social time reference, not a replacement for scientific time as measured by current
        time implementations.  It's for meetings with people across time zones, not measuring
        the duration of thermonuclear reactions.

      <h2>Time Zones</h2>
      <p>
        There is only a single timezone, UTC (Universal Coordinated Time), also known
        as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and colloquially as Zulu.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ebeats are the same throughout the world, and there is no obersvation
        of daylight savings.

      <h2>Notation</h2>
      <p>
        "@248" indicates a time 248 ebeats after midnight, equivalent to a
        fractional day of 05:57:07.2 UTC.

        This site uses the Gregorian calendar, in day-month-year order, separated by periods and prefixed by the
        letter d (#@beat_date)
